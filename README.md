# Sam-Houston-Bank
A simple GUI bank application with client-side database

TO LAUNCH:
You MUST have PyQt 5.6 installed.
With all files in the source folder together, run "login_page.py" to launch the application.
If there are no graphics (just a grey background), try running the application through a different IDE.

ABOUT:
This was my first project using Python, GUI, and SQL. It may be a bit rough around the edges, but I am quite proud of it.
Originally a semester-long group project at my university. The database schema as well as all code was written by me.

TODO:
I hope to add several features to this project as time goes on.
- Automatically refreshing transaction table
- Password resetting
- server-based database
- Multiple bank accounts
- Automatically closing windows
- Scalable UI
